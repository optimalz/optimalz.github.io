2016-02-29 - Photonics West 2016 Conference
We just returned from the 2016's Photonics West held in San Francisco Moscone Center, CA, US. Our contributions to the BIOS Conferences on Ophthalmic Technologies, Optical Coherence Tomography and Coherence Domain Optical Methods in Biomedicine as well as on Neural Imaging and Sensing were successfully presented. We had a great and intense time and are looking forward to next year!
