2016-04-01 New Project Students
This month we welcome two new students to our group. The first is Carlos Reyes, who will study optics for imaging a mouse eye for his Masters thesis in collaboration with Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We also welcome Masters student Konrad Leskovar, who will complete a project focusing on hardware programming for more practical image acquisition. Welcome to the team!
