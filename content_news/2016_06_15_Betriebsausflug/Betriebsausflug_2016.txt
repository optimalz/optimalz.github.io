15.6.2016 "Betriebsausflug"
This year's "Betriebsausflug" (the annual summer trip for all employees of the Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering) began with visiting the interesting castle Forchtenstein. Then, at the Stoob Station in the Mittelburgenland we prepared ourselves with lunch for the sporty afternoon. Our team explored by bicycle handcars the scenic landscape of the Mittelburgenland. In the end the hard work was rewarded with a visit to a local wine cellar for a wine tasting.
