          <p>Today we welcome two new PhD students to our lab! Pablo Eugui has just completed his Masters degree in Biomedical Engineering at the Universidad Publica de Navarra, Spain, and Antonia Lichtenegger has completed her Masters studies in Technical Mathematics and Biomedical Engineering at the Technical University of Vienna. Both will be developing their own new OCT systems. We look forward to working with them!</p>
