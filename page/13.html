          <p>After his work in our group, Carlitos succesfully defended his Master thesis in Karlsruhe Insitute of Technology in Germany. During his thesis, he implemented an optomechanical sample arm to a Visible Light PS-OCT system and created a mouse eye model for visible light. It has been a pleasure to work with him and we wish all the best for him in Mexico. </p>
