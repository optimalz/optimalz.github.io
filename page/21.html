    <p>If you want to find out more about our newly developed spectral domain visible light optical coherence microscopy system, have a look at our recent publication in <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-8-9-4007"><i>Biomedical Optics Express</i></a> which is also featured in <a href="http://www.octnews.org/">OCT News</a>. We investigated amyloid-beta plaques of various sizes in human brain tissue and animal models of Alzheimer's disease. We performed spectroscopic and attenuation analysis of these data. Furthermore a first effort was made to investigate optically cleared mouse brain tissue to increase the penetration depth. </p>
