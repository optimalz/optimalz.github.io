                 <p>Our latest article describes a white light polarization sensitive OCT system which has been specifically designed for imaging the mouse retina. Sub-micron axial resolution was demonstrated, and retinal images of both the healthy mouse and the VLDLR knockout mouse model were acquired by the system.
