          <p>Our novel detection concept for detecting the bright and dark field in OCT systems simultaneously has been recently published in BOE. By exploding the capabilities of few-mode fibers, we demonstrate the posibility of collecting the backscattering signal with different detection profiles, amplifying the scattering characterization of samples in neurological applications.
