          <p>The book "Advanced Optical Methods for Brain Imaging" has just been published. As part of Springer's "Progress in Optical Science and Photonics" book series, this volume provides an overview of state-of-the-art technologies for optical brain imaging and also includes a chapter on OCT imaging written by Bernhard. In this chapter, we introduce the basic principles of OCT and present lots of OCT applications for imaging the brain - also highlighting our research in OPTIMALZ. If you would like to download the book or buy a copy (which probably also makes for a nice present), just click here. <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-981-10-9020-2">link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-981-10-9020-2</a> </p>
