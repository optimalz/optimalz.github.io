          <p>Our recent results from imaging brains of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with our visible light optical coherence microscopy system has been published in Neurophotonics. One hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the development of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. In this paper these plaques were successfully imaged and extensively investigated.
