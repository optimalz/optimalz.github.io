          <p>Matthias Wechdorn defended his diploma thesis today. In his diploma project, Matthias investigated the development of neovascularizations in the VLDLR model. His results were also included in an article we published in IOVS last year. We wish him all the best for his career as a medical doctor in Lower Austria!</p>
