          <p>WOur latest manuscript, entitled "Retinal analysis of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease with multicontrast optical coherence tomography", documents the results of a longitudinal study which has been going on since 2016. The retinas of 24 transgenic APP/PS1 mice and 15 wildtype littermates were imaged using OCT, providing a three-fold contrast of reflectivity, polarization and angiography. The results were then compared to histological analysis of both the retina and the brain. The manuscript was published in Neurophotonics, and can be found here:</p>
