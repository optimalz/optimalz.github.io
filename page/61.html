          <p>Antonia was awarded with the <a href="https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-funding/fwf-programmes/schroedinger-programme//">Schrödinger fellowship</a>.
This fellowship will give her the great opportunity to conduct research for one and a half years at the university of Tsukuba in <a href="http://cog-news.blogspot.com/">Prof. Yasuno's group </a> and finally return to the Centre for Medical Physics and Biomedical engineering in 2021 for half a year.
Her project, entitled "Non-invasive ex-vivo/in-vivo pre-clinical tissue analysis platform" will improve and advance ex-vivo and in-vivo pre-clinical tissue analysis using multimodal optical coherence microscopy. The platform will facilitate investigations in three major pre-clinical scientific fields for cancer research, ex-vivo tissue analysis, in-vivo/in-vitro cell culture and animal model research.</p>
