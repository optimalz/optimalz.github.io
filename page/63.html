          <p>Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a fluorescent substance that is commonly used as a contrast agent for fluorescence imaging.  Rather than use its fluorescent properties, we investigated the use of ICG as a spectral contrast agent for OCT research.  By using the spectral characteristics of ICG, we demonstrated high stability of tracer measurements over time.  The results of this study were published in Optics Letters and can be found here:    </p>
